### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sergio!

#### :book:  Definition

-> BSc Computer Science - Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA) - Brazil

#### :deciduous_tree:  Logs

-> Linux Lover (started with Slackware 11)

-> Tons of fun with on-premises world (from power supply to systems frontend), including a never-ending oncall shift (24/7/365)

-> Systems Architecture - Low-level design, restructuring one huge pice into smaller micro-services, experimenting (RethinkDB is one of a kind ðŸ˜„)

-> Automate everything! If possible, automate the automation! We don't want error-prone processes (Humans can **still** be the users)

-> After last entry, do I need to mention standardizing everything? (Have just mentioned, btw)

-> Networking? Nah... These days nobody needs to calculate how many host IPs you lose if you split a /24 by 8. Is that true? (hint: we still have VPCs in the Cloud Providers!)

-> PHP? Unfortunately familiar with it, but willing to reduce it to a little-to-none grey matter usage (need to make some room for new stuff, like [stunning statistics](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations))

-> Last, but not the least, if you're reading this please do not have a test process/infra layer just to add "override" step into your deployment process. Please, don't.
